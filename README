This little application applies a coloring method on a functional programming
language, Scheme. Instead of coloring keywords, it colorizes parantheses
of the same depth with the same color. Purpose of the application is to make
programmers read and keep track of the code in an easier way.

It uses deprecated HTML tag "font" to colorize.

It is a very simple application. Any comments or suggestions are welcome.

functions.ss is an example scheme file whose colorized html form can be found as
functions.html in the repository.

After compiling the code, you can simply run the program like this:

java ColorizeScheme functions.ss

or to choose a user defined output file name:

java ColorizeScheme functions.ss output.html

I make sure just two things about the correctness of input Scheme code:

- There is nothing, except a comment, outside a paranthesis pair.
- Every matched paranthesis pair is the same. (e.g. [] () )
