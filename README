This little application applies a different coloring method on a functional
language, Scheme. Instead of coloring keywords, it colorizes elements
at the same depth with the same color. The purpose of the application is to make
programmers read and keep track of the code in an easier way.

It uses deprecated HTML tag "font" to colorize.

It is a very simple application. Any comments or suggestions are welcome.

functions.ss is an example scheme file whose colorized html form can be found as
functions.html in the repository.

After compiling the code, you can simply run the program like the following:

java ColorizeScheme functions.ss

or

java ColorizeScheme functions.ss output.html

to choose a user defined output file name.

I make sure just two things about the correctness of input Scheme code:

- There is nothing, except a comment, outside a paranthesis pair.
- Every matched paranthesis pair is the same. (e.g. [] () )
